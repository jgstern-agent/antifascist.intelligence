"""Render the whole manuscript as one file, outside the repository.

Two forms, one reading order. The default is Markdown: the book as plain text,
to read without a PDF, to search or diff the prose across two states, or to
hand to something that takes Markdown. `--tex` writes LaTeX instead -- the
manuscript's own source, whole, bibliography included -- for pasting into
something that should see what the book actually says, macros and all, or for
a compile somewhere this repository is not.

The book is LaTeX (D-065) and neither output is a second source of truth: both
are disposable, written to /tmp by default, and nothing in the repository reads
either back.

Reading order and section numbers come from manuscript/sections/ORDER.tsv, the
same file gen_book.py builds sections.tex from, so both outputs are in the
book's order by construction rather than by a second list kept in step by hand.

What Markdown loses, and knowingly: page breaks, the table of contents, the
title page, the typeset bibliography. Citations survive as Pandoc-style keys
([@smith2020title]) pointing into finishing/refs.bib, which is not inlined.

--tex converts nothing. It is book.tex with every \\input resolved -- the
preamble, the generated draft-status macros, and every section in ORDER.tsv
order -- and finishing/refs.bib inside a filecontents block, with every file
between START and END markers naming its path, so a passage can be traced back
to the file that holds it. `--no-notes` strips both fields that print as a note
in the References -- `note` and `addendum` -- from every bibliography entry.
Of the 275 entries, 199 carry a `note` and 30 an `addendum`.

Neither form carries the draft apparatus (D-335). The Markdown drops the
PREPRINT status line it used to print at both ends, and the LaTeX writes the
preamble's \\draftmodetrue out as \\draftmodefalse, so there is no DRAFT
watermark and no footer on any page: both are proofing marks, and in text
handed to a reader they are noise to be discounted. The book keeps them --
the setting in manuscript/preamble.tex is untouched -- so a PDF built from
the rendered file is a draft with nothing saying so, and is not the proof.

The file compiles as it stands, to the same page count and the same text as
the book, but that is a side effect and not the point: five paragraphs break
their last line differently, because concatenating the sections drops a space
token that \\input contributes at each file boundary. The proof PDF is built
from manuscript/book.tex (finishing/tools/build_tex.sh) and never from here.
